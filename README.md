hi ok i made some stuffs cuz<br />

i have no life and the pain javascript ensues on me is the only thing i feel in life. why do i go on, just to write 400 lines of javascript that noone will ever use
its not even like i use these?? i just  omg help me im Sorry bye heres the   instautctuon.<br />


this is for chroma btw dont try and like do some funky stuff with not chroma cuz you will expericence great pain when i slap you in the face

# how to use it??????
uh ok so it should just workkkk but like you have to change some stuff<br />
IM so sorry if this is incomprehensiahjdsfkl

Hi<br />
the `auto light from waveform.js` file has stuff at the top u can change them and then it does the stuff!!!!!! yayu!!!!! yay!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
its kinda self explainatory (to me because i wrote it) but 
you get a file with sound as an mp3 and you can convert the waveform to chroma lights which is good for vocals because of yeah (i am lazy to do it, so made this.)<br />
you can use one of the ai services that try to extract vocals from a song, and it doesnt have to be perfect because you dont hear that audio.<br />
if you use an ai thingy, make sure the silence at the beginning (from audacity or whatever) is included, or it will be out of sync. (ie use song.ogg from your map)<br />
it will replace all lights of the type and lightID that you use. that is, you can use all other lights of the type (eg big rings, etc), and only the ids you set will be replaced, probably.<br />
this probably doesnt make sense lol sorry<br />
if you have the song project and/or can extract seperate instruments tracks then you can just  automaticaly light it,, yes? idk havent tried <br />


the `old gradient thingy.js` is just a thing i did ill prolly update it at some point. it changes every light of a specific chroma colour in a range, to be a gradient through the time that you set. could be for a long like slowly changing chroma colour or something, cool ok I wish i could tell you how it works but I forgorðŸ’€<br />
dont worry theres comments i wrote like 2 months ago if u wanna use it<br />
